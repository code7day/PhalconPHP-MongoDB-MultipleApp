PhalconPHP MongoDB Multiple Apps Skeleton
=========================================

Database and cache configuration can be found in "/config/config.ini".

The routes were made to be general and work for both front and backend. Add any custom routes, if needed, in "/config/routes.php".

There is an extra library added, RBUtils, having some functions I got used to and can't live without... You can use it as is or remove it from "/library" and also from the "/public/index.php".

All Volt templates are cached in the "/volt" folder. To change the path further you can edit the "/config/config.ini" file.

This skeleton was created for my own needs but anyone else is more than welcome to use it and change it.
